# 🧠 CrowdNet – Deep Learning-Based Human Detection and Counting

### 🎯 Overview
**CrowdNet** is a Deep Learning project for detecting and counting people in crowded scenes.  
It uses modern object detection models (e.g., **YOLOv8**) to analyze real-time video streams and estimate crowd density,  
which can be applied to **security monitoring**, **public safety**, and **smart city management**.

### 🚀 Features
✅ Detect people in static images or live video streams  
✅ Count the number of people in real time  
✅ Display bounding boxes and total count on the screen  
✅ Save detection results (optional)  
✅ Lightweight and easy to deploy
